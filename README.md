[金棒][wiki] is a tool to bludgeon YAML and JSON files from the shell: *the strong made stronger*.

Combining the power of the shell programming environment with the expressiveness of 
[JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/), 金棒 gives you the ability to easily integrate JSON and YAML file 
usage into your scripts.  金棒 supports multiple operating modes allowing you to use it for one-shot access to a subtree,
or interactively to walk a tree from within your script.

This is a work in progress.
